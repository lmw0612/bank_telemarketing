# Bank Telemarketing

**Motivation:** Nowdays, companies use various channels to target specific segements of customers. One of ways to sell their campaign is through a direct marketing to communicate with their customers. The effective and clear target segement strategy would attract more customers to subscribe for a new service and improve customer satisfactions. Therefore, the company needs to analyze the customers on a more granular level such as demographics and finanical background in order to find specific patterns 

In this specific scenario, UCI Machine Learning Repository provides a dataset that cotains clients data from a Portuguese retail bank. The data is collected from 2008 to 2013, which also includes the aftermath of the finanical crisis, so these external factors will be also considered in this project as well
